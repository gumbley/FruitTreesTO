# FruitTreesTO
A site to find fruit trees in Toronto based on the Street Tree Data provided by the City of Toronto: https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/street-tree-data/

Inspired by: https://www.mapto.ca/maps/the-fruit-trees-of-toronto and https://notfarfromthetree.org/

Mulberries are delicious.

Future changes:
1 - automate updates to json trees - city data monthly
2 - consider a way to collect trees not currently included in the city data i.e. in parks... berry bushes?
3 - google analytics
